 *Components always write your Components using PascalCase

*In React(Native/JS) world you must name your component in PascalCase, PascalCase is a naming convention in which the first letter of each word in a compound word is capitalized. Software developers often use PascalCase when writing source code to name functions, classes, and other objects. PascalCase is similar to camelCase, except the first letter in PascalCase is always Capitalized.js
