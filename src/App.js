 * todo:create custom hooks:-
 * 
 * why -create custom hooks 
 * ans- readability, reusability, maintainability,modularity
 * 
 * how create custom hooks
 * ans- whenever we create custom hooks then they have must using state and the have always remember reconciliation process and always they have own life cycle process
 * 
 * when create custom hooks
 * and- always write custom hooks top-level of our app.js components and follow folder structure we put custom hooks inside hook and utils folder got it;
 * 
 *  why move our logic to particular file
 * ans- readability, reusability, maintainability,modularity
 * 
 * <h3>difference between custom hooks ðŸ†š custom helper/utility </h3>
 * 
 * ans - custom hooks:- custom hooks has always written using useState or custom hooks always need and menage state inside our components/function then follow reconciliation presses
 * 
 * ans - utils/ custom logic function :-at the and of only a normal javascript function and they function dose not have react state they just a javascript function got it; 
 * 
 * <p>we move our helper, logic, like filter, sorting, searching, deleting and edit logic etc to particular folder/utils and inside file like  helpers.js</p>
 * 
 * we use any of name like and always put top level of folder:-
 * helper.js
 * utility.js
 * shared.js
 * common.js
 * 
 *
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *
